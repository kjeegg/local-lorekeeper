# Local Lorekeeper: Your Personal Digital Story Assistant

## Welcome to Local Lorekeeper!

Local Lorekeeper is a personal 'pet project' developed to explore how artificial intelligence can help individuals capture, organize, and make sense of their personal stories, memories, or any collection of information they wish to document.

Think of it as a smart, private journal or a personal digital archive that assists you in building a rich and organized record of your experiences, ideas, or research.

**A Key Benefit: Your Privacy Matters.** Unlike many online tools, Local Lorekeeper is designed to run entirely on your own computer. This 'local-first' approach ensures that your sensitive personal information and stories remain private and are never stored on external servers or sent over the internet.

## What Can Local Lorekeeper Do For You?

This project demonstrates the power of AI in personal knowledge management and creativity. It provides tools to help you:

*   **Effortlessly Record Information:** Easily add new entries, thoughts, or events as they happen.
*   **Organize and Structure:** Helps you bring order to your notes, making it easier to find and connect related pieces of information.
*   **Discover Insights:** Uses AI to identify themes, connections, and patterns within your entries that you might not notice on your own.
*   **Summarize and Narrate:** Can help condense lengthy notes into summaries or assist you in transforming your raw entries into coherent narratives or timelines.
*   **Maintain a Private Archive:** Keep all your valuable personal data securely stored only on your computer.

It's designed to be a helpful companion for anyone who values documenting their life, managing complex information, or engaging in creative writing, all while keeping their data private.

## Getting Started (A Simple Overview)

While the technical setup involves a few steps, the process is designed to get the application running on your personal computer. Generally, getting started would involve:

1.  **Getting the Application Files:** Obtaining the project files (like downloading a program).
2.  **Setting up the AI Component:** Installing a necessary piece of software (like Ollama) that allows the AI to run locally on your machine.
3.  **Running the Application:** Starting the Local Lorekeeper program on your computer.
4.  **Accessing via Web Browser:** Interacting with the application through a simple interface that opens in your web browser.

*(Note: Detailed technical installation steps are available within the project files for those who need them, but the goal is a straightforward user experience once set up.)*

## How to Use It

Once running, you interact with Local Lorekeeper through its user-friendly web interface. You can add new entries, browse your existing 'lore', and use the built-in tools to help you organize or generate summaries and narratives based on your data.

## Why This Project Matters

Local Lorekeeper is a demonstration of building practical applications using modern AI technologies (like Large Language Models via Ollama) in a privacy-conscious way. It showcases skills in:

*   **Software Development:** Building a functional application with a user interface and backend logic.
*   **AI Integration:** Utilizing AI models for tasks like summarization and analysis.
*   **Data Management:** Designing a system to store and retrieve information locally.
*   **User Experience Design:** Creating an intuitive interface for interacting with complex data.
*   **Privacy-Focused Design:** Prioritizing user data security by enabling offline operation.

This project highlights the potential for AI to serve as a powerful personal tool, managed directly by the user for enhanced privacy and control.
