## What is Local Lorekeeper?

Local Lorekeeper is a personal, private digital assistant designed to help you capture, organize, and make sense of your life experiences and stories. Imagine having a smart journal or a personal historian that helps you remember important moments, connect ideas, and even helps you write about them.

This project is a personal 'pet project', developed out of interest in exploring how AI can be used for personal organization and storytelling in a private, offline setting.

Unlike online services, Local Lorekeeper is designed to run entirely on your own computer. This means your personal stories and information stay private and are not shared with external servers.

## What Does it Do?

The main goal of Local Lorekeeper is to assist you in documenting and understanding your personal history or any collection of thoughts and events you want to keep track of. It can help you:

*   **Record Your Experiences:** Easily input your thoughts, memories, or daily events.
*   **Organize Information:** Helps structure your entries, perhaps by themes, dates, or importance.
*   **Find Connections:** Uses artificial intelligence to identify relationships and patterns within your recorded information.
*   **Summarize and Narrate:** Can help you summarize long entries or even assist in turning your notes into coherent stories or timelines.
*   **Keep it Private:** All your data is stored locally on your computer, ensuring your privacy.

It's like a personal assistant for your memories, helping you build a rich and organized record of your life or any topic you are documenting.

## How Would Someone Use It?

A user would typically interact with Local Lorekeeper through a simple interface on their computer. They would add new entries, review past ones, and use the system's features to help them organize or understand their information better. The AI works in the background on their machine to provide these helpful features.

## Why is it Useful?

Local Lorekeeper is valuable for anyone who wants to keep a detailed personal record, whether for journaling, creative writing, tracking personal growth, or simply organizing complex thoughts. Its focus on privacy is a key benefit for users who prefer to keep their personal data off the cloud.

## Key Concept:

It's a private, AI-powered digital journal and organizational tool that runs locally on your computer to help you capture and understand your personal history.

## Project Components (High-Level):

*   **User Interface:** The part you see and interact with on your computer.
*   **Lore Engine:** The 'brain' of the system that uses AI to process and understand your entries.
*   **Memory:** Where your entries and the system's understanding of them are safely stored on your computer.
*   **Prompts:** Instructions that guide the AI on how to help you.
